getStaticProps only runs in server side 
the function never run in client side
the codes you write inside getServerSideProps wont included in js bundel
to sent that to browser



you write server-side props directly in get server side props
you can acssesing system using the fs  module or querydata base inside 
get staticProps
dont worry about api keys getStaticProps dont put that on browser
