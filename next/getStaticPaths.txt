what is StaticPaths ? 

when you create paths you can create dynamic paths with [name] 

next pre-render files and send they to server side but what can do  when you dont know 
homw many path do you have ???

getStaticPaths give all path route pages to next and next create that pages with getStaticProps 


in this time  staticpaths solved this problem 
    you doint this :

export async function getStaticPaths() {
    const response = await fetch (url)
    data = response.json()

    cosnt paths = data.map((item)=>{
        return {
            params:{
                postId:`${item.id}`
            }
        }
    })
}

here next create html- js - json pages   



what is fallback do ? 

    fallback : false give us page 404 eror if next dont find that path route 

    fallback : block this is smae with true jsut here page is loading (hamishe age lazem dashtim ro ture mziarim age nashod ro block mizarimesh)

    fallback : true  your chroume send a req to server and fetch json and on this time create html file 
    to create new page but its take time so you need loading  with useRouter you Handel That 

useRouter 

    you import {useRouter} from "next/router"

    const router = useRouter()

    if (router.isFallback){
        return <h1>Loading...</h1>

        return(
            items
        )
    }
