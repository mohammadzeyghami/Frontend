we have a object 

let name = {
    name:"mohammad" ,
    lastName: "zeighami",
    id:2
}

we cant use for of method on objects so what must we do ? 


we change this to array with object.entries 

let newname = name.object.entries(name)

newname look like this  newname=[["name","mohamamd"],["lastName","zeighami"],["id",1]] 

now we can use for of loop on that
